# Data Science Journey 📊📈📉

Welcome to my Data Science journey repository! 🚀 In this space, I'm documenting my exciting transition into the world of Data Science through a series of mini projects and analysis. The primary focus of this repository is to showcase my exploration and learning process as I dive into various machine learning models and data modeling techniques.

# About Me

I'm Camille Buan, and I come from an Accounting and Finance background. As I venture into the realm of Data Science, I'm eager to share my progress, challenges, and the valuable insights gained along the way.

# Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a living document, chronicling my experiences and growth in the field of Data Science. Each project is a stepping stone in my learning journey, and I aim to build a diverse portfolio of practical applications that highlight my evolving skills.

# What to Expect

Project Folders: The repository is organized into different project folders, each representing a unique mini project.
Codebase: You'll find the source code for each project, complete with comments and explanations to make it accessible for others who may be on a similar learning path.
Documentation: I've included detailed documentation for each project, outlining the problem statement, data sources, methodology, and results. This documentation is as much for my own reference as it is to share my insights with the community.

# Learning Focus

My primary focus is on exploring various machine learning algorithms and data modeling techniques. From classic models to cutting-edge approaches, I'm excited to experiment, learn, and refine my skills through hands-on projects.

# Get in Touch

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration! Whether you're a fellow learner or an experienced data scientist, feel free to reach out. Let's connect and grow together.
